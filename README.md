## How to develop

The project uses [`unbuild`](https://github.com/unjs/unbuild) and [`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) to develop and build. With the powerful features offered from [`jiti`](https://github.com/unjs/jiti), we no longer need to use [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for tedious configuration and then watch the local file changes and bundle the modified and developed the modules without [`vite`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) for hot-reload. We can directly run the following command to output the bundled file and get started on development:

```shell
pnpm run packages:stub
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr packages:stub
```

Next, you need to start the the documentation site (with VitePress) for previewing and development. You can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm run docs:dev
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr docs:dev
```

## How to build

```shell
pnpm run packages:build
```

If you use [`@antfu/ni`](https://github.com/antfu/ni), you can also use the following command:

```shell
nr packages:build
```

To build the documentation and preview site, you can use the following command:

```shell
pnpm run docs:build
```
